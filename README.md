# A Recurrent CNN approach to Google Doodle Recognition
## Individual Project
### Trained on 2 million google doodle pictures with and K-Fold accuracy of 82%
#### Some key points:
1. Combination of a Recurrent and Convolutional Neural Netowrk to capture both Spatial and Temporal Data
2. Pseudo-labelling to increase size of train
