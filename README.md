# A Recurrent CNN approach to Google Doodle Recognition
## Individual Project
### Trained on 2 million google doodle pictures with and K-Fold accuracy of 82%
#### Some key points:
1. Combination of a Recurrent and Convolutional Neural Netowrk to capture both Spatial and Temporal Data
2. Pseudo-labelling to increase size of train (Not included in the code)
3. Pre-processing the images to create RGB images to use pretrained models
4. Using Weighted Average Ensemble
5. Training on 2 parallel GPUs
6. Use of Mobile-Net Architecture with pretrained weights
